Open ques to TAs 
--------------------
1. What should be the branch name ? - Name of module working or individual name 
	Individual name

	Yes
	
3. Person doing X role should do branch merge with main ? In that case, if the person is not the repo owner can  he/she do it ?
	Anyone who is part of the repo with collaborator role can merge the branch.
	
4. If we are using Tableau for visualization , does it have to get connected to Db? With  free version is it possible? What are the other options?
	Didnt clarify on this.
	
5. AWS for DB ? - Explain about our process.
	TA suggested using local schema with same db / schema name for the code to work. Using AWS instance adds more complexity.
