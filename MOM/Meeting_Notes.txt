SECOND DELIVERABLE - DASHBOARD
-------------------------------
A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:

Storyboard on a Google Slide(s)
Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create the final dashboard
Description of interactive element(s)


SAMPLE:
---------
1. Add gitignore to repo.

2. Can we push some ML data to DB ? Below item is added as part dashboard. 
	Data (images or report) from the machine learning task


	
Questions to teaching team :
------------------------------
1. If we choose Tableau, we can't connect to DB in public version. Shall we work with exported csv files from DB? - Yes
2. How to incorporate images from initial analysis developed using other visualization tool to final dashboard? - screenshots
3. What is the final deliverable? - Google storyboard or Tableau dashboard link.  - Ppt with dashbaord link
4. Do we need AWS RDS instance to host the db ? - We can host towards end of project for additional exp.
5. ML question - Multi variable regression.


To - do
-----------

1. Data processing - Anu
	Cleanup the data, fix the missing data issue in DB, Update latitude, longitude columns with correct data.
		1. CAUSE_ID is null in FIRE_INCIDENTS table for which CAUSE_DESCRIPTION has values.
	
			SELECT CAUSE_ID,CAUSE_DESCRIPTION FROM FIRE_INCIDENTS 
			WHERE CAUSE_ID IS NULL;

		2. FIRE_LOCATIONS table has less record than FIRE_INCIDENTS & FIRE_IMPACTS. Missing 76 records 
			SELECT * FROM FIRE_INCIDENTS WHERE
			FIRE_NAME NOT IN  (SELECT FIRE_NAME FROM FIRE_LOCATIONS);
			
2. 	Tableau - Tara - build 1 report.

3. ML - Add pressure, Increase accuracy, Change features.

4. Initial analysis - Shailee - 

-----------
Doubts:

1. Google slides storyboard is like what Dhivya has done, we shall present a storyboard of what our dashboard is going to look like.

2. Initial analysis: trying to plot a column of interest and check the outliers and see if there is any constraints that we might face in the future and we should be aware of.

3. Images of initial analysis and Machine learning should be presented in tableau, either by importing image or data as a csv file to plot it which is more professional, this is something that we must speak about tomorrow.
